## Constructing terms (*continued*)

Constructing terms of a structure with many fields is particularly 
1. boring;
1. error-prone; and
1. far from mathematical usage: to construct a term of a complicated structure we might want to 
use a term of a simpler one and "only add what is left to update the simpler one to the richer".

There are two ways, somewhat parallel to the `MyStructure := ...` *vs* `Mystructure where ...` 
syntaxes.
* The syntax `with` instructs Lean to take all possible labels from that term and to only 
ask for the remaining ones, and it works when using the `:=` construction:

        example (x : OneNat) : TwoNat := {x with snd := 37}

    Calling `with` triggers both
    * collecting all useful fields from a term; and
    * discharging all useless ones.

    These features can be applied simultaneously and independently.
* The syntax `__` has the same behaviour, and works when using the `where` construction.

In both cases, the "extra-fields" are forgotten, and thrown away.

+++ Labels Matter
The big difference between `TwoNat`, and `Couple` are the names of the fields:

    structure TwoNat where
        fst : ‚Ñï
        snd : ‚Ñï

    structure Couple where
        left : ‚Ñï
        right : ‚Ñï

These names **are relevant**! You might think of a term of type `TwoNat` (or `Couple`) as a
pair of *labelled* naturals, and that a structure is a collection of *labelled* terms. So,
the terms `t := {fst := 2, snd := 1} : TwoNat` and the term `t' := {left := 2, right := 1} : Couple` 
have **nothing to do with each other**.
+++

+++ More about `with`
Technically, `with` updates a value: so `{fst := 1, snd := 2} with fst := 3` is
`{fst := 3, snd := 2`}.

Using `with` without specifying a new value simply instructs Lean to consider all fields on 
their own without changing their value (possibly picking only the ones that are needed, 
while discharging the others).

# Extends

We have already seen the `extends` syntax before: let's analyse its behaviour in details knowing 
how `structure`s work.

The main point is to generalise to the whole type what we did for terms using `with` or `__`.

* Suppose we've already defined a structure `PoorStructure` with fields `firstfield,...,nth_field` 
and  we want a new *richer* structure `RichStructure` that also contains the fields
`(n+1)st_field,...,rth_field`. We can either
    * forget that we had `PoorStructure` and declare
        
            structure RichStructure where
            firstfield : firstType
            secondfield : secondType
            ...
            rth_field : rth_Type

    * declare that `RichStructure` extends `PoorStructure` inheriting terms from the latter:

            structure RichStructure extends PoorStructure where
                (n+1)st_field : (n+1)st_Type
                ...
                rth_field : rth_Type

+++ In details
* The process can be iterated, yielding a structure extending several ones:

        VeryRichStructure extends Structure‚ÇÅ, Structure‚ÇÇ, Structure‚ÇÉ where
            ...

* If the parent structures have overlapping field names, then all overlapping field names 
must have the **same type**. 
* If the overlapping fields have different default values, then the default value 
from the **last** parent structure that includes the field is used. New default values in the child
(= richer) structure take precedence over default values from the parent (= poorer) structures.

* The `with` (and `__`) syntax are able to "read through" the extension of structures.

+++ In true Math
Remember the piece of code

    class AddMonoidBad (M : Type) extends Add M, AddZeroClass M

We want to define an instance of `AddMonoidBad` on `‚Ñï`. Several ways:
1. type `:=`, go to a new line with `_`, wait for üí°and fill all the fields;
1. remember that `‚Ñï` already has an `add` and a `zero`, so they can be discharged;
1. actually observe that we have an instance `AddMonoid` on `‚Ñï`, and that 
    
        class AddMonoid (M : Type u) extends AddSemigroup M, AddZeroClass M where
        nsmul := ...
        nsmul_zero := ...
        zero_nsmul := ...

so all the fields that we need are already there: use `with` or `_` to pick them up. To do so, we
need to find the name of the term in `AddMonoid ‚Ñï`, for which we can do

    #synth AddMonoid ‚Ñï -- Nat.instAddMonoid

# Some ancillary syntax

+++ The anonymous variable
When declaring a "very basic" function, the syntax 

    fun x ‚Ü¶ simple expression depending on x

might be too heavy. We can replace it by

    (simple expression depending on ¬∑)

where
* round parenthesis are crucial;
* `¬∑` is typed `\. = ¬∑` and not `\cdot = ‚¨ù`

+++ Minimally/Weakily inserted implicit variables
We've seen the syntax `{` and `}` to insert *implicit* variables. But in `Mathlib` we find the 

    def Injective (f : Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤) : Prop :=
        ‚àÄ ‚¶Éa‚ÇÅ a‚ÇÇ‚¶Ñ, f a‚ÇÅ = f a‚ÇÇ ‚Üí a‚ÇÅ = a‚ÇÇ

What are this funny double curly braces `‚¶É` and `‚¶Ñ`?

Lean has a mechanism for automatically insterting implicit Œª-variables when needed; so, as soon as
it encounters an implicit hole, it populates it with an anonymous variable. 

#### This can be problematic.

Let's define

    def myInjective (f : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï) : Prop :=
        ‚àÄ {a b : ‚Ñï}, f a = f b ‚Üí a = b

with usual implicit variables, and let's see what goes wrong ... ‚Üí `‚åò`


* The syntax `‚¶É` introduces so-called *minimally/weakly inserted implicit arguments*, that only
becomes populated when something explicit *following them* is provided (lest the whole term would
not type-check).

If nothing is inserted *after*, they stay implicit and the `Œª`-term is treated as
a honest term in the `‚àÄ`-Type.

* The reason why `exact @hg` worked is that the role of the `@` is to *disable* this mechanism of 
automatically populating implicit holes, that also allows to explicitely populate the fields when
needed.

# Exercises

1. When defining a `ModuleWithRel` instance on any `NormedModuleBad` we used the relation "being in the
same ball of radius `1`". Clearly the choice of `1` was arbitrary.

    Define an infinite collection of instances of `ModuleWithRel` on any `NormedModuleBad` indexed by
    `œÅ : ‚Ñù‚â•0`, and reproduce both the bad and the good example.

    There are (at least) two ways:

    * Enrich the `NormedModule`'s structure with a `œÅ`: this is straightforward.
    
    * Keep `œÅ` as a variable: this is much harder, both because Lean won't be very happy with a
    `class` depending on a variable and because there will *really* be different instances even with
    good choices, so a kind of "double forgetfulness" is needed.

1. Prove the following claims, stated in the section about the non-discrete metric on `‚Ñï`:
    * `PseudoMetricSpace.uniformity_dist = ùí´ (idRel)` if the metric is discrete.
    * As uniformities, `ùí´ (idRel) = ‚ä•`.
    * Is the equality `ùí´ (idRel) = ‚ä•` true as filters?
    * For any `Œ±`, the discrete topology is the bottom element `‚ä•` of the type `TopologicalSpace Œ±`.


1. In the attached file `PlanMetro.pdf` you find a reduced version of Lyon's subway network. I have
    already defined the type of `Stations`.

    1. Find a way to formalize lines (both ordered and non-ordered), and the notion for two stations of
    being connected by a path.

    1. Prove that being connected is an equivalence relation.

    1. Test that *Vieux Lyon* and *Part Dieu* are not connected, but *Vieux Lyon* and *Croix-Paquet*
        are.

    1. 1. Formalize a program that receives two stations in input and 
        * throws an error if they are not connected;
        * provides a/the list of lines (without stations) needed to travel between them, if they are
            connected.

    1. Prove that if we add a "circle line" connecting all terminus', then every two stations become
    connected.

    1. Formalize the notion of "correspondance" and prove that that in the above configuration with
    a "circle line" every trip requires at most two correspondences.
