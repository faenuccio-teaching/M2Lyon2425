Some of the examples below are taken from Rob Lewis' course taught at Brown University in
Winter 2023. Others are taken by [a series of Youtube lectures by Siddhartha Gadgil](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_bVGic_CrGtMw1QVFRLRsZjcymm56mRi). I thank them both warmly for letting me use them.

The main reference for these topics is the very beautiful book [Metaprogramming in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/), together with [Functional Programming in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/) for all aspects (and exercises) concerning monads.

Metaprogramming is a *huge* subject, and we're going to simply give a quick glance. I am **not an expert**.

## Macros

Macros are simply ways of creating a new tactic by packing existing tactics together. The syntax is

```lean
macro "name_of_your_tactic" : tactic =>
  `(tactic | *your sequences of tactics*)
```

+++ Notes
* if you want to insert a variable that you might call later (like in `intro h`) or that is already in scope (like in `cases h`), this is an
 "identifier" and you can insert it as a variable by typing `ids:ident`. To call it later, you use a
 dollar, as in `$ids:ident` (with its type).
* You can also require that square brackets (or parenthesis, or other stuff) are used by doing

```lean
macro "foo" "[" ids:ident "]" : tactic => ...
```

* You need a backtick before the parenthesis in `tactic` otherwise what you are writing gets
compiled, and not stored.
* If you want to add several tactics on several lines, **use parenthesis**.

## Interlude: Monads

Monads are typeclasses for functions `m : Type* → Type*`  with some
extra-property: 

    class Monad (m : Type* → Type*) where
    pure : α → m α                 -- an "embedding" of α` in m α
    bind : m α → (α → m β) → m β   -- lifts f : α → m β to f : m α → m β.

(a compatibility is required between `pure` and `bind`, but we neglect it).

The interest of `bind` is that it allows composition: if `f : a → m β` and `g : β → m γ` then we would like `g ∘ f : a → m γ`, but it does not type-check. On the other hand,

```lean
fun (a : α) ↦ bind (bind (pure a) f) g
```

is well-formed and it is the "correct" composition. The infix version of `bind` is `>>=` so the above reads

```lean
fun (a : α) ↦ pure a >>= f >>= g : α → m γ
```

* One example of a monad is `Option α`: it is the type of terms either of the form `some a` for `a : α`, or equal to the extra-term `none : Option α`. Here, 

      pure (a : α) = some a
      bind (some a) f = some f a
      bind none f = none

  `Option` is useful to encode errors: `List.get : ℕ → List α → Option (List α)`, so that `L.get n = none` whenever `n > L.length`.


* Another useful example is `State σ α` where `σ : Type*` is some "state-carrying" type: it is simply

      abbrev State (σ α : Type*) : Type* := σ → (σ × α)

  so a term sends a state to a *pair* of a (possibly updated) state, and an `a : α`. The monad here is `m := State σ` (for fixed `σ`), and its monad instance comes from

      pure (a : α) := fun s ↦ (s, a) (: σ ↦ σ × α)
      bind n f :=             -- here n : State σ a; and f : α → State σ β
        fun s ↦
          let (s', a) := n s            -- recall that n s : σ × α
          (f a) s'
          
    since `f a : State σ β = σ → σ × β`, the final `f a s'` has type `σ × β`, and therefore `bind n f : σ → σ × β`

  This monad is useful to store values with a "state", or to mimic mutable variables.

## Going Meta
+++ Expressions and variables
Expressions are the most basic objects Lean deals with, and they can virtually be anything. They are defined as the following inductive type:

```lean
inductive Expr where
  | bvar    : Nat → Expr                              -- bound variables
  | fvar    : FVarId → Expr                           -- free variables
  | mvar    : MVarId → Expr                           -- meta variables
  | sort    : Level → Expr                            -- Sort
  | const   : Name → List Level → Expr                -- constants
  | app     : Expr → Expr → Expr                      -- application
  | lam     : Name → Expr → Expr → BinderInfo → Expr  -- lambda
  | forallE : Name → Expr → Expr → BinderInfo → Expr  -- depnd't arrows
  | letE    : Name → Expr → Expr → Expr → Bool → Expr -- let expressions
  -- less essential constructors:
  | lit     : Literal → Expr                          -- literals
  | mdata   : MData → Expr → Expr                     -- metadata
  | proj    : Name → Nat → Expr → Expr                -- projection
```
All constructors above construct things whose meaning should be pretty clear, except potentially for free and meta variables (`lit`, `mdata` and `proj` can be forgotten for now): we'll inspect those later.

+++ Variables


Free- and Metavariables play a special role. 

### Free variables 
Free variables are the "usual ones", like the variable `x` in `x + 2`. They do not even to actually be typed, they've simply got an identifier `FVarId`.


`⌘`


### Metavariables 


To quote Lean's documentation,
```
Metavariables are used to represent "holes" in expressions, and goals in the tactic framework. Metavariable declarations are stored in the MetavarContext. Metavariables are used during elaboration, and are not allowed in the kernel, or in the code generator.
```
Each metavariable has a unique name, usually rendered as `?m` or `?m_197`, and a target type `T` which is *explicit*. It comes with a local context containing hypotheses (the `Γ` such that `Γ ⊢ ?m : T` is well-typed).

Both "holes" to be filled by type-inference and, most importantly, **goals** are represented by metavariables. To close a goal, we must provide an expression `e` of the target type `T`: internally, closing a goal corresponds to assigning the value `e` to the metavariable; we write `?m := e` for this assignment.

To "play" with metavariables we need our code to be *elaborated* somewhere, so what typically happens is that we `def`ine some code (possibly acting on metavariables, that do not exist at the moment of our writing) and then we declare some `elab`oration procedure where we see this code in action.

`⌘`


+++

+++ Creating new tactics
This all relies on a monad `TacticM`: as it turns out, there are *zillions* of monads all over `Lean` and `Mathlib`, and *thousands* of "moral
interpretations" thereof. Concerning `TacticM  α`, you might think of its terms as actions that
1. perform some tactic; and then
1. return a term in `α`.

Terms in `TacticM Unit` simply perform the tactic, since `Unit` only contains `_`.

### Warm-up
Let's begin by implementing two tactics, one (`Count`) that simply counts the number of variables in the
context and one (`ExtrFn`) that extract all variables that are functions.

```lean
  def Count : TacticM Unit :=
  (do
    let lctx ← getLCtx
    let n := lctx.decls.toList.length
    do logInfo m!"There are {n - 1} variables in scope")
```
* The `-1` gets rid of the goal metavariable.

* `getLCtx` returns the local context, and `lctx` is the array containing it.


```lean
def ExtrFn : TacticM Unit :=
  do
    let mut xs := #[]
    let lctx ← getLCtx
    for lh in lctx do
      if !lh.index == 0 && lh.type.isForall 
        then xs := xs.push lh.userName
    do logInfo m!"The list of functions in the context is {xs}"
    return                -- this is optional, it is a _ : Unit
```
* `let mut` introduces a _mutable_ variable (Lean is a functional programming language!) so that 
the final `let xs :=...` works.

* `#[...]` is Lean syntax for *arrays* (as opposed to lists).

* for each `lh` in `lctx`, we get its type through `lh.type`. Then we check if `lh` is a function: this is precisely when its type
`lh.type` is a `∀` (a "forall", also called a Π-type).

* `logInfo` is the tactic writing some message in the info-views: in VSCode
this also shows up in the main window (in another colour).


Finally,

```lean
elab "count_variables" : tactic => Count
elab "show_fn_var" : tactic => ExtrFn
```
* ` elab` is the command enforcing some definition as a tactic

`⌘`

### Acting on the goal and on the assumptions

Since the goal is a metavariable, to change its state we need to *assign* it: we musht attach an expression to it, that will be its value, checking its type is the main target.

```lean
elab "solve" : tactic => do
    let mvarId : MVarId ← Lean.Elab.Tactic.getMainGoal
    let metavarDecl : MetavarDecl ← mvarId.getDecl
    let locCtx : LocalContext := metavarDecl.lctx
    for ld in locCtx do
      if ← isDefEq ld.type metavarDecl.type then
        mvarId.assign ld.toExpr
```
* Once we have the goal (both `mvarId` and `metavarDecl`: one as an identifier, the other as declaration) we loop the context `locCtx` to see if check if anything we meet has the same type as the goal. In that case, we assign the metavariable to this thing.

#### DeepMind Induction
While solving the IMO 2024, Google DeepMind came up with a proof, performing [induction on `12`](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/imo-2024-solutions/P2/index.html) (on `10+2`, actually...)
after which, of course, the state was exactly the same (but somewhat easier for GDM to solve). We want to detect this behaviour.

    elab "WhatsThis " n:term : tactic =>
      do
        let metavarVars ← getLCtx
        for lh in metavarVars do
          if `n == lh.userName then
            return
          else
            do logInfo m!"Do you really mean {n}?"
        return

*  The `if` clause checks whether the term `n` appears in the goal. And then

    ```lean
    macro "DeepMind_induction " ids:term : tactic =>
      `(tactic | (WhatsThis $ids
                  induction $ids))
    ```

`⌘`


#### Back to `∧`
We want a tactic that *completely* destructs all `p ∧ q` *hypotheses* found in the local context:
more complicated than the macro-defined `split_and` because that one *only acted on the goal*,
here we navigate all assumptions.

  ```lean
  partial def DestrAnd : TacticM Unit :=
    withMainContext
      do
        for lh in ← getLCtx do
        let eq := Expr.isAppOf lh.type ``And
        if eq then 
          liftMetaTactic
            fun goal ↦ do
            let subgoals ← MVarId.cases goal lh.fvarId
            let subgoalsList := subgoals.toList
            pure (List.map (fun sg ↦
                InductionSubgoal.mvarId
                (CasesSubgoal.toInductionSubgoal sg)) subgoalsList)
          DestrAnd
          return
  elab "destruct_and" : tactic => DestrAnd
  ```

* `eq` checks whether `lh` coincides with `?m_1 ∧ ?m_2` for some metavariables `?m_1` and `?m_2`.
* the `liftMetaTactic` is an impressively powerful command that subsumes all actions on the **list** of goals. 
* the `let subgoals` call create a new goal or each `eq` match; and the next call performs `cases` on it.
* Finally a recursive call to `DestrAnd` to detect nested `⋀`: in particular, `DestrAnd` might not terminate and we're forced to declare it `partial`.

`⌘`

#### Modifying terms

We now present a tactic that, for each natural `n : ℕ` in the context, creates a new variable whose value is `2 * n`. This is decomposed in three (and a half...) steps:

1. A tactic `findNat` that identifies the `ℕ`'s in the context.

    ```lean
    def findNat : TacticM (List LocalDecl) := withMainContext do ...
    ```

    * This performs a tactic (so, it has some "meta"-effect) and produces a list of local declarations (our sought-for `ℕ`'s).

    * `withMainContext` is a safeguard option: it tells the tactic to constantly *update* the context, to prevent it to trying to perform actions on a state that has itself modified.

1. A tactic `listNat` that lists them (simply informative).

    ```lean
    def listNat : TacticM Unit := withMainContext do ...
    elab "listNat" : tactic => listNat
    ```

    * This only performs a tactic.
    * Since it is elaborated, it can be applied in tactic state, unlike `findNat`.

1. A tactic `doubleNat` that, for each `h` found by `findNat` produces a new term and assigns to it the value `2 * h.val`. 

    * It relies on `mv.assertHypotheses`, that takes a list `hs` of hypotheses and converts a given goal `Γ ⊢ T` into 
    
    
    ```lean
    Γ, (hs[0].userName : hs[0].type) ... (hs[n].userName : hs[n].type) ⊢ T
    ```

    * It also uses `_root_.Lean.MVarId.intro1P` that "moves things on the top of the heap" in Rocq terms: from the Lean doc,

    ```
    Introduce one object from the goal, preserving the name used in the binder. Returns a pair made of the newly introduced variable and the new goal. This will fail if there is nothing to introduce, i. e. when the goal does not start with a ∀, λ or let.
    ```

*3½.*  As a bonus, a version of `doubleNat` on stereoids that *really* produces `2 * n` instead of `Nat.mul 2 n`, by working at *syntactic* level, rather than `Expr`-level.
