# Functions

## A first trap

* As you know (do you?), functions among types are *primitive notions*;
* but sometimes we want to speak about functions among *sets*;
* **functions among sets are different gadgets than functions among types**. 

This requires a small change of perspective.

Let's inspect the following code:
```lean
example (α β : Type) (S : Set α) (T : Set β) (f g : S → T) :
    f = g ↔ ∀ a : α, a ∈ S → f a = g a :=
```
It *seems* to say that `f = g` if and only if they coincide on every element of the domain, yet... `⌘`

+++ Take-home message
To apply `f : α → β` to some `s ∈ S : Set α`, *restrict* it to the *subtype* `↑S` attached to `S`.

+++

## Operations

Given a function `f : α → β` and sets `(S : Set α), (T : Set β)`, there are some constructions and properties that we are going to study:

+++ The **image** of `S` through `f`, noted `f '' S`.
This is the *set* `f '' S : Set β` whose defining property is
```lean
f '' S := fun b ↦ ∃ x, x ∈ S ∧ f x = b
```
Unfortunately it comes with a lot of accents (but we're in France...): and with a space between `f` and `''`: it is not `f'' S`, it is `f '' S`.



`⌘`
+++

+++ The **range** of `f`, equivalent to `f '' univ`.
I write *equivalent* because the defining property is
```lean
range f := (fun b ↦ ∃ x, f x = b) : β → Prop = (Set β)
```
This is not the verbatim definition of `f '' univ` : there will be an exercise about this.
+++

+++ The **preimage** of `T` through `f`, denoted `f ⁻¹' T`.
This is the set
```lean
f ⁻¹' T : Set α := fun a ↦ f a ∈ T
```
This also comes with one accent and _two_ spaces; the symbol `⁻¹` can be typed as `\^-1`.

`⌘`
+++

+++ The function `f` is **injective on `S`**, denoted by `InjOn f S` if it is injective (a notion defined for functions **between two types**) when restricted to `S`:
```lean
def : InjOn f S := ∀ x₁ ∈ S, ∀ x₂ ∈ S, f x₁ = f x₂ → x₁ = x₂
```

In particular, the following equivalence is not a tautology:
```lean
example : Injective f ↔ InjOn f univ
```
it is rather an exercise for you...

# Inductive Types and Inductive Predicates

## Inductive Types

So far, we
* met some abstact types `α, β, T : Type`, and variations like `α → T` or `β → Type`;
* also met a lot of types `p, q, (1 = 2) ∧ (0 ≤ 5) : Prop`;
* struggled a bit with `h : (2 = 3)` *versus* `(2 = 3) : Prop`;
* also met `ℕ`, `ℤ`;
* considered the subytpe `{a : α // S a} = ↑S` corresponding to a set `S : α → Prop`.

How can we *construct* new types? For instance, `ℕ`, or "the" subtype `↑S`, or `True : Prop`?

+++ Using **inductive types**!

* *Theoretical* perspective: this is (fun & interesting, but) hard: you'll see it in other courses.
* *Practical* one: think of `ℕ` and surf the wave. It has two **constructors**: the constant `0 : ℕ` and the function `succ : ℕ → ℕ`, and every `n : ℕ` is of either form.

For example
```lean
inductive NiceType
  | Tom : NiceType
  | Jerry : NiceType
  | f : NiceType → NiceType
  | g : ℕ → NiceType → NiceType → NiceType
```
constructs the "minimal/smallest" type `NiceType` whose terms are 
1. Either `Tom`;
1. Or `Jerry`;
1. Or an application of `f` to some previously-defined term;
1. Or an application of `g` to a natural and a pair of previously-defined terms.

For example, `f (g 37 Tom Tom) : NiceType`.


> **Every type in Lean is an inductive type**


In order to
1. construct terms of type `NiceType` you can use the ... *constructors*!;
1. access terms of type `NiceType` (in a proof, say), use the tactic `cases` (or `cases'` or `rcases`):  the proofs for Tom and for Jerry might differ, so a case-splitting is natural.

## Inductive Families and Inductive Predicates

Recall the 
```lean
def EvenNaturals : Set ℕ := (· % 2 = 0)
```

* For every `n`, there is a type `(EvenNaturals n) : Prop`. 
* This is a *family* of types, surely a family of *inductive* types!
* But is it an inductive type *itself*?

+++ The target
When defining `inductive NiceType` one can specify where the output lives:
```lean
inductive NiceType : Type
  | Tom : NiceType
  | Jerry : NiceType 
  | f : NiceType → NiceType 
  | g : ℕ → NiceType → NiceType → NiceType
```

or 
```
inductive NiceProp : Prop
  | Tom : NiceProp
  | Jerry : NiceProp
  | f : NiceProp → Prop
  | g : ℕ → NiceProp → NiceProp → NiceProp
```
> The default is `Type`.

### Families
If you want a *family* of types (say, of propositions), you simply say it straight away!
```lean
inductive NiceFamily : ℕ → Prop
  | Tom : NiceFamily 0
  | Jerry : NiceFamily 1
  | F : ∀n : ℕ, NiceFamily n → NiceFamily (n + 37)
  | G (n : ℕ) : ℕ → NiceFamily n → NiceFamily (n + 1) → NiceFamily (n + 3)
```

*Inductive Predicates* are inductive families in `Prop`.
