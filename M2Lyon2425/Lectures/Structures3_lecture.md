# Local Instances and Type Synonyms

We've seen that declaring instances has deep consequences: typically, there must be a unique
instance of a certain class on a given type, and once we declare such an instance things are stuck
forever.

This might be too rigid. Two ways out are *local instances* and *type synonyms*.

## Local Instances
Inside a `section` we can use the `attribute [instance] myStructure` or
`attribute [-instance] myStructure` to upgrade `myStructure` to an instance or remove it from the 
list of declared instances. Finding who is `myStructure` in a specific use-case can be non-trivial 
(won't be too hard neither).

An equivalent syntax is `local instance` instead of `instance` (but this does not work to *remove*
instances).

+++ An example from Mathlib
In Mathlib, `‚Ñï` is endowed with the discrete uniformity, coming from the discrete metric:
1. The metric, induced from that on `‚Ñù`, satisfies `‚àÄ n : ‚Ñï, Metric.ball n (1/2 : ‚Ñù) = {n}`.
1. The uniformity (*i. e.* a filter on `‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï`) is the principal filter containing the
diagonal: `Uniformity ‚Ñï = ùí´ (idRel)` where
    * `idRel` is the identity relation, so the subset `{p : ‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï | p.1 = p.2}`;
    * `ùí´ (idRel)` is the collection of all subsets in `‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï` that contain `idRel`, seen as a filter;
    * It can be proven that the uniformity induced by the discrete metric is indeed 
        `ùí´ (idRel)`;
    * Filters and uniformities are ordered, and one can prove that `ùí´ (idRel) = ‚ä•`, the bottom element.

Since the discrete metric induces the discrete topology, `UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace ‚Ñï = ‚ä•`
where now `‚ä•` is the discrete topology.

**GOAL** : Provide another non-discrete uniform structure on `‚Ñï` that still induces the discrete
topology.

**Reference** : This is actually [a counterexample](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Counterexamples/DiscreteTopologyNonDiscreteUniformity.html) in Mathlib.

**Idea** : Set

            dist n m := |2 ^ (- n : ‚Ñ§) - 2 ^ (- m : ‚Ñ§)| : ‚Ñù

We're identifying `‚Ñï` with the subset $2^{-‚Ñï} ‚äÜ ‚Ñù$, inheriting the distance from this embedding and
looking at the induced topology.

**Consequence** This new uniformity will be so crazy that the identity sequence `id : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï` is
actually Cauchy (Cauchy sequences in discrete uniform spaces are only the eventually constant ones).

+++ The problems
* How can we "replace" the discrete uniformity on `‚Ñï` with another one? 
* How can we check that our results (for instance about `id` being Caucy) re-become *false* in the 
usual setting where `UniformSpace ‚Ñï := ‚ü®‚ä•‚ü©`?
* How can we check that the topology remained the same, namely the discrete one?


**Solution** Use local instances.

## Type Synonyms

Another strategy that works more globally is to use *type synonyms*. The idea is to create a copy 
of a type, in a way that this copy inherits some instances of the original type, but not all of 
them. 

+++ Difference between `abbrev` and `def`
This is probably beyond what is meant for this course, and certainly beyond my paygrade. 

You can think that "`abbrev` is a reducible `def`", whatever this means.

**Concretely**: Lean "looks deeper" inside the definition of an `abbrev` than a `def`.

`‚åò`

Suppose `X` is a type, and that
    
    instance : ClassOne X := ...

up to 
    
    instance : Class_n X := ...`.

We want a new type `newX` that has some of the above instances (and to perform this **fast**).

+++ The **wrong** way: `abbrev newX_bad := X`.
For Lean, `newX_bad` and `X` are **equal**: so, every declaration with variable `newX_bad` will
accept a variable of type `X`. In particular, an `instance : MyClass newX_bad := ...` will result in
an `instance : MyClass X := ...`.

We are also changing the *old* type `X`.This is **not** what we wanted.
+++

+++ The **good** way: `def newX_good := X`.
We're creating a completely new type `newX_good`. The problem is that it has no property at all, 
whereas we might want to inherit some properties from `X` (although probably not all of them).

We can use the syntax

    instance : myClass newX_good := inferInstanceAs (myClass X)

that instructs Lean to *copy* the instance term of `myClass` from `X` to `newX_good`.

# Structures
* Main reference: [The Lean Language Reference](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/), in particular [¬ß 3.4.2](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/The-Type-System/Inductive-Types/#structures).

The usual way to define a `structure` is to write its name, then `where` (or `:=`) and then the
list of fields that we want a term of the structure to be made of

    structure MyStructure where
        firstfield : firstType
        secondfield : secondType
        ...
        lastfield : lastType

or equivalently

    structure MyStructure :=
        firstfield : firstType
        secondfield : secondType
        ...
        lastfield : lastType

where each field is a term in some known type. Every field can depend upon the previous ones.

* The `nth` field of a structure can be *any* term (of the right type...) but if we write

    `nth_field : nth_Type := myterm`
    
we are declaring that, if left unspecified, the `n`th term will be
`myterm`. This is typically what we do when `nthType = Prop`: we do not want that *some property*
is satisfied, but that *our sought-for property* is satisfied.


Declaring a structure as above automatically creates several terms:
1. A term `MyStructure.mk : firstType ‚Üí secondType ‚Üí ... ‚Üí lastType ‚Üí MyStructure` to *construct*
terms; the name `.mk` can be overridden with the syntax `constructor_name ::` on the second line (so
starting the list of fields on the third line).
1. A term `MyStructure.nthfield : MyStructure ‚Üí nthType`: this *projects* a term of type
`MyStructure` onto its `nth` field.
1. If the attribute `@[ext]` is prepended on the line before the declaration, a theorem 
`MyStructure.ext` is created, of type

    ‚àÄ {x y : MyStructure}, x.firstfield = y.firstfield ‚Üí ... ‚Üí x.lastfield = y.lastfield ‚Üí x = y

saying that if all fields of two terms coincide, the terms themselves coincide.

* If `nthType = Prop`, the arrow `x.(n-1)stfield = y.(n-1)stfield ‚Üí x.nthfield = y.nthfield ‚Üí 
is skipped thanks to proof irrelevance. Another theorem `MyStructure.ext_iff` is also added, 
that adds the reverse implication.

4. It the `@[class]` attribute is added (possibly with syntax `@[ext, class]`), a new class is
created as well so that `instance : MyStructure := someterm` becomes accessible. 

The call `whatsnew in` on the line preceeding the structure makes Lean shows all
newly created declarations.

+++ Use of parameters
It is also possible to define structures that depend on parameters. The syntax is the usual as for 
`def` or `theorem`.
+++

The call `#print MyStructure` has Lean print all fields, parameters and constructors.

#### Examples
We will define a structure `OneNat`, that "packs" a single natural number; the structures `TwoNat` 
and `Couple` that pack to numbers;  or the structure of order pairs that pack two numbers where the 
second is larger or equal than the first, so it is a `Prop` : this is called a *mixin*.

## Constructing terms

To look at the details, let's try to buid some terms of the above structures.

When doing so, `VSCode` comes at rescue: once we declare that we are looking for a term in a
structure `MyStructure` (*i. e.* in an inductive type with one constructor, itself a function with
several arguments), we can type
    
    def MyTerm : MyStructure :=
    _

(beware that the underscore `_` **must not be indented**), and a (blue) 
bulbüí°appears. Click on it to  generate a *skeleton* of the structure at hand, so 
you do not need to remember all fields by heart.

Either usingüí°or not, there are three ways to define a term of a structure:

1. `myTerm : MyStructure :=`, followed either by
    * `by constructor` and then you're in tactic mode; or 
    * `{firstfield := firstterm, secondfield := secondterm, ..., lastfield := lastterm}`. 

1. `myTerm : MyStructure where` and then the list `nthfield := nthterm`, each one a new (indented) line (observe that theüí°-action replaces `:=` with `where` automatically).

1. Using the so-called *anonymous constructor* provided by `‚ü®` and `‚ü©`: just insert the list of 
terms `‚ü®firstterm, secondterm, ..., lastterm‚ü©` after `myTerm : MyStructure :=` and Lean will 
understand.


* Remember that `class`es are a special case of `structure`s: so, definining an `instance` as we 
did in the last lecture really boils down to constructing a term of a certain `structure`. Points 
1. ‚àí 3. above are crucial for this.

# Exercises

1. Define the class of metric spaces (but call them `SpaceWithMetric` to avoid conflict with the
existing library) as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space#Definition, and deduce
an instance of `TopologicalSpace` on every `SpaceWithMetric`.

Explain why this is the *wrong* choice, on an explicit example, and fix it.
