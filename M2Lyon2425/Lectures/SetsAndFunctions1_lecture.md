# Sets

## Introduction
Sets are **primitive** objects when doing classical, old-school, pen-and-paper mathematics: 
* no *definition*;
* only *rules* about how these objects work (unions, intersections, etc.).

That's all you need: do you look at $f\colon S \to T$ as $f\subseteq S\times T$?

Objects normally represented by a set are formalised in Lean as *types* with some extra-structure.

So, for Lean, sets are **no longer primitive objects**; yet
* sometimes we still want to speak about *sets* as collections of elements 
* we want then to play the usual games.


## Definitions

+++ Every set lives in a given type: it is a set of elements (*terms*) of a type:
```lean
variable (α : Type) (S : Set α)
```
expresses that `α` is a type and `S` is a set of elements/terms of the type `α`. On the other hand,
```lean
variable (S : Set)
```
does not mean "let `S` be a set": it means nothing and it is an error.
+++

+++ A set coincides with the test-function defining it.

 Given a type `α`, a set `S` (of elements/terms of `α`) is a *function*
```lean
S : α → Prop
```
so `(Set α) = (α → Prop)`.

* This function is the "characteristic function" of the set `S`; 
* the `a ∈ S` symbol means that the value of `S` is `True` when evaluated  at the element `a`;
* So, the positive integers are a *function*!

Yet, given a function `P : α → Prop` we prefer to write `setOf P : Set α` rather then `P : Set α` to avoid _abusing definitional equality_.

### Some examples: 
1. How to prove that something belongs to a set?
1. Positive naturals;
1. Even numbers;
1. An abstract set of `α` given by some `P`.

+++ Sub(sub-sub-sub)sets are not treated as sets-inside-sets.

Given a (old-style) set $S$, what is a subset $T$ of $S$ *for you*?
1. Another set such that $x\in T\Rightarrow x \in S$.
1. A collection of elements of $S$.

Now,
1. stresses that $T$ is a honest set satisfying some property;
1. stresses that it is a set whose elements "come from" $S$.

We take the **first approach**: being a subset is *an implication*
```lean
    def (T ⊆ S : Prop) := ∀ a, a ∈ T → a ∈ S
```
`⌘`

* Can also _upgrade_ sets to types: `T : Set S` for `S : Set α` means `T : Set ↑S = Set (S : Type*)`.

### Some examples: 
1. Double inclusions;
1. Subsets as sets;
1. This upgrade (_coercion_) from `Set α` to `Type*`.

## Operations on Sets
+++ **Intersection**
Given sets `S T : Set α`  have the
```lean
def (S ∩ T : Set α) := fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∧ a ∈ T
```
* Often need **extensionality**: equality of sets can be tested on elements;
* realted to _functional extensionality_ : two functions are equal if and only they have if they take the same values on same arguments;
* not strange: sets *are* functions.

+++ **Union**
Given sets `S T : Set α` we have the
```lean
def (S ∪ T : Set α) := fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∨ a ∈ T
```

And if `S : Set α` but `T : Set β`? **ERROR!**

`⌘`
+++

+++ **Universal set & Empty set**
* The first (containing all terms of `α`) is the constant function `True : Prop`
```lean
def (univ : Set α) := fun a ↦ True
```
* The second is the constant function `False : Prop`
```lean
def (∅ : Set α) := fun a ↦ False
```
**Bonus**: There are infinitely many empty sets!

+++



+++ **Complement and Difference**
* The complement is defined by the negation of the defining property, denoted `Sᶜ`.
```lean
Sᶜ = {a : α | ¬a ∈ S}
```
The superscript `ᶜ` can be typed as `\^c`.

* The difference `S \ T : Set α`, corresponds to the property
```lean
def (S \ T : Set α) = fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∧ a ∉ T
```

+++ **Indexed Intersections & Indexed Unions**
* Can allow for fancier indexing sets (that will actually be *types*, *ça va sans dire*): given an index type `I` and a collection `A : I → Set α`, the union `(⋃ i, A i) : Set α` consists of the union of all the sets `A i` for `i : I`.
* Similarly, `(⋂ i, A i) : Set α` is the intersection of all the sets `A i` for `i : I`.
* These symbols can be typed as `\U = ⋃` and `\I = ⋂`.
