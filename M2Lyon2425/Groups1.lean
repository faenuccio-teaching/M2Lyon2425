Announcement about projects: you should let us know what final exam project you want
to work on by November 15, but it would be better if you did it earlier (say after
you come back from fall break).
Also, to communicate your project topic to us, you should create a branch in the
`M2Lyon2425` git repository and add in it a file containing the project description.
This will teach you to use branches, which will be necessary when you turn in your
project.

/-## Structures

A *structure* is a type consisting of a collection of data, with optionally some
conditions that the data should satisfy (which are just data of type `Prop`).

An *instance* of a structure is a particular example of the structure.
-/

-- The following structure has no condition, it is just the data of three real numbers.
@[ext]
structure Point where
  x : ℝ
  y : ℝ
  z : ℝ

-- We can define terms of type `Point` in several different ways.
def myPoint1 : Point where
  x := 2
  y := -1
  z := 4

def myPoint2 : Point :=
  ⟨2, -1, 4⟩

def myPoint3 :=
  Point.mk 2 (-1) 4

-- We can access the fields of a term of type `Point` using the projections `.x`, `.y`
-- and `.z`.
#check myPoint1.x
#check myPoint1.z

-- The annotation `@[ext]` automatically generates a theorem `Point.ext` that says that
-- two terms of type `Point` are equal if and only if all their fields are equal.

#check Point.ext

example : myPoint1 = myPoint2 := by
  apply Point.ext
  · rfl
  · rfl
  · rfl

-- Of course `Point` is "the same" as `ℝ × ℝ × ℝ`, but one advantage of `Point` is
-- that, as the fields are named, we can ignore the order on the coordinates.

def myPoint4 : Point where
  z := 2
  x := -1
  y := 4

/- On to groups! There are two choices: making the underlying set of the group a
field of the structure, or not.-/

structure BundledGroup₁ where
  carrier : Type*
  one : carrier
  mul : carrier → carrier → carrier
  inv : carrier → carrier
  mul_one : ∀ (x : carrier), mul x one = x
  one_mul : ∀ (x : carrier), mul one x = x
  mul_assoc : ∀ (x y z : carrier), mul (mul x y) z = mul x (mul y z)
  inv_mul_cancel : ∀ (x : carrier), mul (inv x) x = one
-- You might want to put one more condition called `mul_inv_cancel`, but we can
-- actually prove it from the others, see later.

structure Group₁ (α : Type*) where
  one : α
  mul : α → α → α

  one_mul : ∀ (x : α), mul one x = x
  mul_assoc : ∀ (x y z : α), mul (mul x y) z = mul x (mul y z)
  inv_mul_cancel : ∀ (x : α), mul (inv x) x = one

/- Mathlib chose the second solution, because this way we can put a group structure
on an already defined type, such as `ℤ` or `Equiv₁ α α`.

(But when we define the category of groups, its objects are terms of a type resembling
`BundledGroup₁`.)

lemma Group₁.inv_eq_of_mul {α : Type*} (G : Group₁ α) (x y : α) :

-/

/- The last example is kind of painful to write. We would like to:
(1) not have to give a name for the group structure on `α`;
(2) be able to use more standard notation like `1`, `x * y`, `x⁻¹`.

The answer to (1) is `instance magic`, and the answer to (2) is `inheritance and
instances`.

Let's start with (1). As said before, an instance is a particular example of a
structure. We would like to be able to declare a particular `Group` instance on
a structure such as `Equiv₁ α α` or `ℤ` and never have to refer to it explicitly
again, and we would also like Lean to be able to guess what this instance is.
This is done by the (black, black) magic of *type class inference*.

We already saw implicit arguments written `{x : α}`, Lean is supposed to figure
these out from context.

We can also have arguments written `[grp : Group α]` and Lean is supposed to
synthesize these using type class inference, i.e. by looking through a number
of previously declared *instances*. (Usually we write `[Group α]`, since we are
not supposed to need to use the name.)
-/

#synth Group ℤ -- oh no, mathlib only uses `Group` for groups written multiplicatively!
-- this helps when we come to rings and have two composition laws written `+` and `*`
#synth AddGroup ℤ
#synth Ring ℝ
#synth Field ℚ
#synth LinearOrder ℝ

lemma Group₁.mul_inv_cancel' {α : Type*} [Group₁ α] (x : α) :
     mul x (inv x) = one := sorry
-- This does not work, because in order to use a structure for type class inference,
-- we should declare it as a *class*.

  mul : α → α → α

/- *How does Lean know that a group is a monoid ?*

Remember that a *monoid* is a set with an associative composition law and a unit
(but not necessarily inverses). For example, `ℕ` is a monoid for addition.

It is easy enough to define a class for monoids in Lean.
-/

class Monoid₁ (α : Type*) where
  one : α
  mul : α → α → α
  mul_one : ∀ (x : α), mul x one = x
  one_mul : ∀ (x : α), mul one x = x
  mul_assoc : ∀ (x y z : α), mul (mul x y) z = mul x (mul y z)

instance : Monoid₁ ℕ where
  one := 0
  mul a b := a + b
  mul_one := sorry
  one_mul := sorry
  mul_assoc := sorry

/- But every group is also a monoid, and Lean should know this. How do we tell it?

Mathlib's answer is *inheritance*. We actually define the class of groups to
extend that of monoids, by adding the fields that `Monoid₁` doesn't have.
-/

class Group₃ (α : Type*) extends Monoid₁ α where
  inv : α → α
  inv_mul_cancel : ∀ (x : α), mul (inv x) x = one

#print Group₃

-- We get a function sending a group to a monoid, but Lean can also do that
-- automatically.
#check Group₃.toMonoid₁

instance {α : Type*} : Group₃ (Equiv₁ α α) := sorry

section Tests

variable (α : Type*)
#synth Monoid₁ (Equiv₁ α α)

end Tests

-- NB: We can also use inheritance with structures that are not classes.
-- Here is a stupid example.

structure Involution₁ (α : Type*) extends Equiv₁ α α where
  inv : ∀ (x : α), toFun (toFun x) = x

#print Involution₁

  toFun := fun x ↦ -x
  invFun := sorry
  left_inv := sorry
  right_inv := sorry
  inv := sorry


/- What about using notation?

What we do is declare all the "pieces" making up a group as a different classes
and introduce notation for them (so they can be used in various contexts). Then we
"glue" them together using inheritance.
-/

-- Let's start by defining a class for types with a binary operation. We use
-- the diamond notation for the operation so it doesn't clash with anything else.

class Dia₁ (α : Type*) where

  dia_assoc := sorry -- should really have made the associativity of `Equiv₁.trans`
                     -- into a lemma earlier!

-- To define monoids, we just need to put semigroups and unit elements together,

class Monoid₂ (α : Type*) extends DiaOneClass₁ α, Semigroup₁ α

#print Monoid₂ -- note that Lean knows that the binary operations coming from the
