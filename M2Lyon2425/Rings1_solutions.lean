  # Modified operations
  Operations are defined on types so that have to be defined for all values.
  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to ``extend'' the existing definitions.

  # Ideals and quotients
  The theory of ideals in Mathlib has only been developed in the case of commutative rings

example (h : Equivalence r) : Setoid α := ⟨r, h⟩ -- Corrected statement

-- The quotient of `α` by the setoid `s`is called `Quotient s`, it comes with the
-- natural map `Quotient.mk s` from `α` to `Q`

example (s : Setoid α) : α → Quotient s := Quotient.mk s

-- The Quotient axiom `Quot.sound` then says that if two elements are in relation then their classes
-- in the quotient are equal
example (a b : α) (s : Setoid α) (h : a ≈ b) : -- (Use `\~~` to write `≈`)
    Quotient.mk s a = Quotient.mk s b := Quotient.sound h

-- Note that the quotient and the quotient map comes in three different versions: `Quotient.mk`,
-- `Quotient.mk'` and `Quotient.mk''` depending (respectively) if the setoid is given as an
-- argument, should be inferred by typeclass inference or is given as an implicit argument.

-- If `I` is an ideal of `R`, then there is an equivalence relation and thus a setoid of `R`
-- constructed from it (in fact, it is constructed for submodules) and Lean can infer from that
-- the quotient `R ⧸ I`.

  # Let's construct our own version of `ℤ`

  The ideal being that the class of `(a,b)` corresponds to the integer `a - b`.
