/- ## Exercise
"In the attached file `PlanMetro.pdf` you find a reduced version of Lyon's subway network. I have
already defined the type of `Stations`.

1. Find a way to formalize lines (both ordered and non-ordered), and the notion for two stations of
being connected by a path.

2. Prove that being connected is an equivalence relation.

3. Prove that if we add a "circle line" connecting all Terminus', then every two stations become
connected.
