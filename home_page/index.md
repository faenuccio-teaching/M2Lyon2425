This is the webpage for the Lean courses of the program <a href="http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2024-2025-394652.kjsp">"Higher Algebra and Formalised Mathematics"</a> of the Advanced Master in Mathematics in Lyon for 2024/25. For the original `git` repository, click <a href="https://github.com/faenuccio-teaching/M2Lyon2425">here</a>.

## Prerequisites 

You will need to do the following tasks before the start of the course. We will help you do these tasks during the "Installation party" on September 4th.
* Make sure that you have a working wifi, usually via Eduroam.
* Install a working `git` installation: for some help, you can have a look at <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/misc/git.html">this page maintained by Patrick Massot</a>.
* Install a Lean editor (we *strongly* suggest that you install VSCode).
* Clone the course repository on your laptop using the address: https://github.com/faenuccio-teaching/M2Lyon2425.git (more about that during the "Installation Party").
* Download the Mathlib build cache on your computer (more about that during the "Installation Party").
* Create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> to be able later on to submit your work.
* Create an account to the <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean Community Chat</a> on <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>. Note you can use your GitHub account for that. Once you've got it, ask to one of the teachers to be invited to join the dedicated stream for this course.
* Administrative information about the program (dates, credits, internship, etc.) can be found <a href="http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/informations-pratiques-388390.kjsp?RH=1403617207802&RF=1638194375361">here</a>.
